# July 18th: Mostly finished the PCB!

I went with a 87 key matrix for a TKL keyboard and 87 neopixels for RGB ( More RGB More FPS)
Haven't selected the stabilizers yet after selecting the stabilizers I will start making the case for it

I have to fix my key placement
Did the row wiring and added GND and 5v plane on Top and Bottom Cu layer
