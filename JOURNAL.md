# Total Time Spent: 26.5 hours

# July 18th: Mostly finished the PCB!

I went with a 87 key matrix for a TKL keyboard and 87 neopixels for RGB ( More RGB More FPS)
Haven't selected the stabilizers yet after selecting the stabilizers I will start making the case for it

# July 21th: Why is them so hard to route?

Someone suggested to switch to back mounting neopixels so switched to those type of neopixel footprint
Need a lot more time to place them in place
